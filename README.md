# Lemonentry.

### The *classic* branch contains the original version of the Combustible Lemon. It is also available on the [Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=106451008).

## About
The combustible lemon was originally a [toybox](http://gmod.wikia.com/wiki/Toybox) addon for Garry's Mod, inspired by [Portal 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/620). It has been kept compatible with the game, but has remained largely unchanged since its inception.

## What's this?
Following several requests, a new version is in development here on GitHub! It will feature several weapons and entities.

## Planned changes
- A new model
- Complete rewrite with features:
  - The original lemon will act as a contact explosive when thrown at speed with the physics/gravity gun
  - When _used_, the lemon will blurt out Cave Johnson's infamous speech before detonating
  - The lemon will (eventually) have editable properties providing new functionality, including following players
  - Extra entities will be available with varying flavours:
    - _Tame_ lemons won't detonate when thrown around but will retain their use functionality, as well as exhibit differing behaviours
	- _Angry_ lemons will detonate at the slightest touch and will cause all other lemons in the vicinity to do so
	- _Patient_ lemons seem benign but will eventually explode (when you least expect it)
	- Other kinds may follow in the future
  - Two new weapons will be available for use:
    - The _Lemonade_ will have similar behaviour to a grenade
	- The _Lemon Launcher_ will shoot various flavours of lemons, like a Cannon
- Optimisation for the latest version of Garry's Mod

## How do I get it?
- You can get the latest stable(ish) beta release from the _master_ branch using Git or SVN
- New and potentially unstable changes will be pushed to isolated branches for alpha testing
- When enough features have been added and tested, a release version will be available on the Steam Workshop
- The original version of the combustible lemon will be available on the _classic_ branch
